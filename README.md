# NeuroSim: Detecting Structural Brain Alterations through Simulated Activity using TVB.



# Overview: NeuroSim
Detecting Structural Brain Alterations through Simulated Activity using TVB is a research project aimed at exploring how structural changes in the brain, specifically white-matter degeneration, impact neural activity. Using The Virtual Brain (TVB) platform, the project involves simulating a whole-brain network, introducing controlled structural alterations, and then analyzing whether these changes can be detected from the resulting simulated brain activity.
# Key Objectives:
- Simulation of Whole-Brain Network: Use TVB to create a realistic model of a human brain network, replicating the complex interactions between different brain regions.
- Inducing Structural Alterations: Mimic white-matter degeneration within the simulated network to observe how these structural changes influence neural connectivity and activity patterns.
- Activity Analysis: Assess whether the induced structural alterations are detectable through changes in the simulated brain activity, potentially offering insights into early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.
